## 1. What is AMQP?
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a standard for message-oriented middleware that enables systems to communicate asynchronously by sending messages through brokers like RabbitMQ. It helps build scalable, decoupled, and reliable architectures by allowing producers to send messages without needing to know who the consumers are. With features like message queuing, acknowledgments, routing, and transactions, AMQP is well-suited for microservices and event-driven systems. It's like dropping a task into a shared to-do list, and one team member picks it up to complete — you don’t know who, but it gets handled.

## 2. What it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?
a. guest:guest — This part represents the username and password for authenticating with the RabbitMQ broker. The first guest is the username, and the second guest is the password. This is the default username/password for RabbitMQ unless changed.

b. localhost:5672 — localhost is the host address where RabbitMQ broker is running. In this case, it is our local machine. While 5672 is the port number where RabbitMQ broker is listening for AMQP conncections.
